# Assertions
    - Validate the correctness of a unit
    - Declares predicate is going to be TRUE

Example:
    `assert.equal('dog', 'cat');`
        - Throws error if not

# Assertion Library
- Collection of assertions
    - Many more than Node.js Assert
    - Comparisons for many structures
    - Promise support

- Provides APIs to create predicates
    - Interfaces like TDD and BDD

Additional Assertion Examples:
    `exists` => neither null nor undefined
    `typeOf` => compare to Object.prototype.toString
    `instanceOf` => instance of constructor
    `propertyByPath` => nested properties
    `finally` => object is a promise and will resolve to a value

# Assertion Language Chaining
Special kind of assertion.
    - Checks nothing
    - But pass value between assertions

- Natural language descriptions
- Multiple aliases
    - be, an, of, a, and, been, have, has...

# Assertion Library Examples
- Assert => native, included in Node.js
- Chai
- should.js => gaining popularity
- code (from Hapi.js)
