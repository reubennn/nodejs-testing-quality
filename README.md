# Nadiaâ€™s Garden Restaurant

This is a Node.js and Express website that accepts and lists restaurant reservations. Improve it with the lynda.com course, "Node.js: Testing and Code Quality" by Jon Peck.

The backend contains intentional mistakes, like weak validation on email addresses. Inconsistencies in coding style are also intentional.

## LinkedIn Learning Course: Node.js: Testing and Code Quality

A maintainable codebase should have clean and easy-to-manage code. In this course, Jon Peck shows how to gauge quality, implement testing, and measure code coverage in your Node.js apps. To help you better understand these key concepts, he walks through how to clean up a buggy restaurant booking app. First, Jon reviews testing and code quality fundamentals. Next, he shows how to find errors by linting your code base, and explores different testing frameworks and their components. Finally, he demonstrates how to write unit and functional tests to exercise the code base, then determine what code was executed with a code coverage report.

## LinkedIn Learning Course

- Based off of the LinkedIn Learning course [Node.js: Testing and Code Quality](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/node-js-testing-and-code-quality/) by Jon Peck

## Learning Objectives

- What is code quality?
- Testing and code quality fundamentals
- Coding conventions and standards
- Creating and enforcing coding standards
- Unit, integration, and functional testing
- Test-driven development test specificatons
- Behavior-driven development test specifications
- Finding errors with linting
- Extending an ESLint shareable config
- Validating correctness with unit testing
- Replacing and inspecting with stubs, spies, and mocks
- Code coverage and why it matters
- Coverage with continuous integration

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The server runs on port 3000.

There are three routes:

- <http://localhost:3000/> - homepage
- <http://localhost:3000/reservations> - submit a reservation booking request
- <http://localhost:3000/admin> - view all booking requests; basic auth login/password `admin`

The server persists using a SQLite3 database named `database.sqlite` in the site root.

## Development

This project **does not** use EditorConfig to standardise text editor configuration.
Visit <http://editorconfig.org> for more details.

### Testing

This project uses Mocha and Chai for testing.
Visit <http://mochajs.org> and <http://chaijs.com> for details.

To execute tests:

```bash
npm test
```

### Debugging

This project uses <https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug> for development logging. To start `nodemon` and enable logging:

```bash
npm run debug
```

## FAQ

- Q: Why didn't you store the time submitted?
  - A: I wanted to reduce the number of fields and simplify testing.
- Q: Wouldn't it be easier if the form submitted a datetime string instead of building and parsing one?
  - A: Yes, it would, but the form logic is simpler. Either way, someone has to do the work.
- Q: Why did you mix a callback and a Promise in `lib/reservations.js`?
  - A: `Joi` doesn't support Promises, but it does support callbacks. I wanted to show how to test both kinds of asynchronous code.
- Q: How'd you handle cross-platform support?
  - A: Avoided relative directories, used `cross-env` to transform environmental variables.

## Credits

This is an adaptation of a WordPress site hosted at <http://587672.youcanlearnit.net/>

The conversion:

- Archive original with wget
- Strip out unrelated functionality
- Reorganize JavaScript and Stylesheets into logical directories
- Converted HTML into Jade / Pug templates using <http://html2jade.org/>

The front end should be mostly unchanged from the original.
